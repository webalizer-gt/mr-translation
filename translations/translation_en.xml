		<text name="mr_helpTitle_01" type="headline" text="What can you expect?" />
		<text name="mr_helpText_01_01" type="paragraph" text="Basically, the moreRealistic mod (MR) adds an enhanced physics engine that better simulates real life with almost all available pieces of equipment. This has a number of effects on the game." />
		<text name="mr_helpText_01_02" type="paragraph" text="One of the most notable effects is the reduced ability of tractors to pull heavy trailers or implements. You will actually have to use tractors that have the proper horsepower requirements to pull various implements or trailers." />
		<text name="mr_helpText_01_03" type="paragraph" text="In general, tractors will slow down when going uphill, speed up when going downhill, and take longer to accelerate when they are pulling a load." />
		<text name="mr_helpText_01_04" type="paragraph" text="But there is more..." />
		<text name="mr_helpText_01_05" type="caption" text="Pictures: 1 and 2 = realistic physics, 3 = max speed not limited by the game engine." />

		<text name="mr_helpTitle_02" type="headline" text="Vehicles (1)" />
		<text name="mr_helpText_02_01" type="paragraph" text="All base vehicles converted to MR vehicles are usually more maneuverable, which means easy and precise control of small movements. Example: It is easier to attach tools, implements or trailers (you have more control, this is especially true when playing with a keyboard)." />
		<text name="mr_helpText_02_02" type="paragraph" text="All default converted vehicles get real life top speed, both in forward and reverse direction. No more 15 km/h limitation in reverse." />
		<text name="mr_helpText_02_03" type="paragraph" text="There is no more 'infinite' motor (engine) braking capability. If the load is too high for the engine to maintain the speed (full trailer, going downhill), the vehicle can go faster than the top speed. Like in real life, you will hear the engine overrev (too much rpm) in such case. For this reason, you have to use the wheel brakes to reduce the speed or stop the vehicle like in real life." />
		<text name="mr_helpText_02_04" type="paragraph" text="Real engine torque curves are applied and fuel consumption is based on delivered power and rpm. There is also a new CVT transmission that manages the engine rpm according to power demand (less power = less rpm, engine brake needed = more rpm)." />

		<text name="mr_helpTitle_03" type="headline" text="Vehicles (2)" />
		<text name="mr_helpText_03_01" type="paragraph" text="The moreRealistic engine features rolling resistance. It means it will be harder to pull a trailer in a ploughed field than on the road. It also means you will not be able to maintain the top speed of a vehicle, even on a flat road, if the vehicle power is not sufficient." />
		<text name="mr_helpText_03_02" type="paragraph" text="Wheel size and type do have an influence to the game now. A 'street' tyre will be easier to pull on the road compared to other tyres, but harder in fields. A wider tyre will reduce the rolling resistance in field, but will increase it on the road. Taller tyres are always better for any purpose. Note: Crawler systems have very high rolling resistance (not good for carting purpose as in real life)" />
		<text name="mr_helpText_03_03" type="paragraph" text="The forces being assigned by the wheels to the ground are now closer to what can be found in real life. It means the weight of the pulling vehicle is very important when playing with a MR vehicle." />
		<text name="mr_helpText_03_04" type="paragraph" text="Weights are not 'just for show' now and will play a role in the final 'tractive efficiency' of your vehicle at work. With too much ballast you will consume more fuel and time for the same worked area.	Without enough ballast you will not be able to pull the implement or lose too much speed and power because of the slipping.	Be aware that the 'optimal' operating range is relatively large for most working situations." />

		<text name="mr_helpTitle_04" type="headline" text="Implements" />
		<text name="mr_helpText_04_01" type="paragraph" text="With MR, there is no more ON/OFF power requirement for implements. When using an implement, the power consumed by the PTO or the force required to pull it will depend on what you are actually doing with the implement.	It means you can pull a large implement with a medium tractor at lower working speeds (providing there is enough weight on the tractor wheels).	It also means you will clearly see a difference when using a more powerful tractor." />
		<text name="mr_helpText_04_02" type="paragraph" text="All implements have capacity limits. The most common is the speed limit which means that even by using a monstrous tractor, you will not be able to work at unrealistic high speeds with an implement." />
		<text name="mr_helpText_04_03" type="paragraph" text="For some implements, there are other limits. Example: Balers do have a limited flow capacity. You can't pickup huge amounts of material in short time. It will also depend on the material you are picking up. Grass being harder to process than straw." />
		<text name="mr_helpText_04_04" type="paragraph" text="MR vehicles are more sensitive to center of gravity (mass distribution). Even if it can be hard to tip over an empty trailer, it's pretty easy with a fully loaded one (especially when the cargo is heavy)." />

		<text name="mr_helpTitle_05" type="headline" text="Seeding" />
		<text name="mr_helpText_05_01" type="paragraph" text="Please note that when playing MR, the seeds consumption will be similar to what we can expect in real life." />
		<text name="mr_helpText_05_02" type="paragraph" text="It means you will not have to refill your seeder as often as with the base game. You can even sow multiple fields without refilling for some fruits like rapeseed or sugarbeet." />
		<text name="mr_helpText_05_03" type="paragraph" text="When direct seeding, it will be easier to pull the seeder on already cultivated/ploughed land." />
		<text name="mr_helpText_05_04" type="caption" text="Pictures: already cultivated ground (left), direct seeding (right)." />			

		<text name="mr_helpTitle_06" type="headline" text="Fertilising" />
		<text name="mr_helpText_06_01" type="paragraph" text="All MR sprayers and spreaders feature speed dependant flowrate. It means you don't have to drive at full speed to not waste fertiliser. You can go at your own pace and take your time doing the job." />
		<text name="mr_helpText_06_02" type="paragraph" text="When using a seeder featuring a fertilising unit, most of the time, the fertiliser quantity used will be smaller than by using other fertilising tools." />
		<text name="mr_helpText_06_03" type="paragraph" text="Fertiliser is one of the heaviest product in the game. Base density for bulk fertiliser is 1.1 and for liquid fertiliser, this is even greater at 1.28 !" />

		<text name="mr_helpTitle_07" type="headline" text="Harvesting" />
		<text name="mr_helpText_07_01" type="paragraph" text="MR's combines max working speed depends on the combines threshing capacity, the engine power, the fruit, the yield and the cutter bar (header power consumption and width)." />
		<text name="mr_helpText_07_02" type="paragraph" text="When chopping the straw, the power consumption is increased. Same as when unloading on the move." />
		<text name="mr_helpText_07_03" type="caption" text="Pictures: full width (left), half width (right)." />	

		<text name="mr_helpTitle_08" type="headline" text="Baling" />
		<text name="mr_helpText_08_01" type="paragraph" text="With MR, baling is more rewarding than selling loose windrow material. A small square bale being the more rewarding, then round bales and then large square bales." />
		<text name="mr_helpText_08_02" type="paragraph" text="Bales also have close to real life weight, which is dependant of the bale 'fillLevel' and its material. Example: It will be harder to pull a bale trailer full of hay bales compared to straw bales." />

		<text name="mr_helpTitle_09" type="headline" text="Object handling" />
		<text name="mr_helpText_09_01" type="paragraph" text="Default 'grabbing' tools such as the log fork or bale grab, now have the 'MR claw' feature. This means that when you fully close the tool, the object being picked up is locked and will not release randomly." />
		<text name="mr_helpText_09_02" type="paragraph" text="This is especially useful when trying to carefully place logs or bales in a trailer. You can also 'grab' pallets if you can't get good result with forks." />

		<text name="mr_helpTitle_10" type="headline" text="Forestry" />
		<text name="mr_helpText_10_01" type="paragraph" text="All tools really make use of tractors engines power. The three woodcrushers have been enhanced to be more enjoyable to use. Even the small Heizomat is now easy to feed." />
		<text name="mr_helpText_10_02" type="paragraph" text="By using the 'MR claw' feature, it is also easier to handle logs with the crane on the log trailer and on the forwarder." />

		<text name="mr_helpTitle_11" type="headline" text="Ground wetness" />
		<text name="mr_helpText_11_01" type="paragraph" text="During and after a rain, the ground 'wetness' really matters when playing MR. Depending on the rain type, duration and intensity, it can become impossible to work in fields. Especially true when there are some slopes or your tractor is not oversized compared to the implement." />
		<text name="mr_helpText_11_02" type="paragraph" text="It can also take some time for the wetness to build up, but eventually you will lose traction force and the rolling resistance will be increased." />
		<text name="mr_helpText_11_03" type="caption" text="Pictures: 0% wetness (left), 70% wetness (right). Cultivated field, street tires on the trailer, 26T total vehicles mass." />	

		<text name="mr_helpTitle_12" type="headline" text="Density, volume, mass" />
		<text name="mr_helpText_12_01" type="paragraph" text="In the basic game, the weight of a filled trailer is not nearly realistic. Example: If you fill a 20 m3 (cubic metre) trailer with 20,000 liters of water, the mass of the filling should be 20 tons. In fact, you will get only 10 tons because the density of the filltypes are reduced up to 50% for playability reasons." />
		<text name="mr_helpText_12_02" type="paragraph" text="Wait! What is density? If you have a homogeneous substance, such as water, the mass of an amount of the substance is proportional to its volume. The ratio of mass to volume is then a constant, called the density. The density of an object is therefore found by dividing the mass by the volume. In other words, density = mass / volume." />
		<text name="mr_helpText_12_03" type="paragraph" text="MR makes use of real life figures for the density of every filltype. You will notice that carting grain around has become much different. Even with a powerful tractor, you will notice a considerable decrease in speed when trying to cart a trailer full of grain up hills. With less powerful tractors you may not be able to make it up these hills. You may have to take a different route or take the trailer to the unloading place half full." />
		<text name="mr_helpText_12_04" type="paragraph" text="Crops densities varie from 0.42 for sunflower to 0.83 for maize." />

		<text name="mr_helpTitle_13" type="headline" text="Field jobs" />
		<text name="mr_helpText_13_01" type="paragraph" text="There is now some random factor when choosing a mission. You can get more time but less money per unit of time. And you can get less time but more money per unit of time." />
		<text name="mr_helpText_13_02" type="paragraph" text="Rewards have also been balanced so that it is not so clearly advantageous to do missions, rather than tend to your own farm." />

		<text name="mr_helpTitle_14" type="headline" text="Pricing board" />
		<text name="mr_helpText_14_01" type="paragraph" text="With moreRealistic activated, the different colours in the sell prices board will better reflect if you should or should not sell your product. Green figures are now always better than white or red ones. No need to read the whole table to know if there are good prices for one of your crops." />

		<text name="mr_helpTitle_15" type="headline" text="Display" />
		<text name="mr_helpText_15_01" type="paragraph" text="Below the vehicle display (speed etc ...) you can read two values that can be useful for your gameplay." />
		<text name="mr_helpText_15_02" type="paragraph" text="The 'average slippage' on the left side shows you how good or bad the traction of your vehicle is. If you can't feel the impact of ballast maybe you can see it there. A wheeled tractor at work should be between 8 and 15% slippage." />
		<text name="mr_helpText_15_03" type="paragraph" text="On the righthand side you can see the average fuel consumption per hour." />
		<text name="mr_helpText_15_04" type="paragraph" text="You can move the display by holding down the modifier key (standard = right CTRL) and dragging it with your mouse." />
		<text name="mr_helpText_15_05" type="paragraph" text="By pressing 'right CTRL + Keypad 7' you can turn the display on and off. If you have a limited network connection you can save traffic by turning it off!" />
		<text name="mr_helpText_15_06" type="paragraph" text="The Host or Admin can turn off the transfer of slippage and fuel data by pressing 'right CTRL + Keypad 8'. If you have a limited network connection you can save traffic by turning it off!" />
